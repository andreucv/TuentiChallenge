<h1>Repo of 4th TuentiChallenges in 2014</h1>
Was my first TuentiChallenge

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
First: 
About selecting from a listed file students that the features you search match with them 
Was explined like:
We had an elections at University and a list of all students that had voted with its features in a file.
We know its features and the elector that have voted to. 
We want know its names. Do a search and sort its names in alphabetic sorting.

Second:
The FIA has a new circuit planner that you put a line with these chars: "-", "/", "\", "#".
"#": means the start lane
"-": means a straight part of the circuit
"/": means a right curve
"\": means a left curve

FIA writes the circuit in one dimension like: ---/----\---#-/---\--------/---------\
and you have to write it in two dimensions.
