<h1>Repo of 4th TuentiChallenges in 2014</h1>
Was my first TuentiChallenge
======

<h2>First</h2> 
About selecting from a listed file students that the features you search match with them
Was explined like:<br>
We had an elections at University and a list of all students that had voted with its features in a file.<br>
We know its features and the elector that have voted to. <br>
We want know its names. Do a search and sort its names in alphabetic sorting.<br>

<h2>Second</h2>
The FIA has a new circuit planner that you put a line with these chars: "-", "/", "\", "#".<br>
"#": means the start lane<br>
"-": means a straight part of the circuit<br>
"/": means a right curve<br>
"\": means a left curve<br>
FIA writes the circuit in one dimension like: ---/----\---#-/---\--------/---------\ <br>
and you have to write it in two dimensions.
